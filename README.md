# Chess-AI-mentor
GM level chess bot helping you to play chess in live explaining the moves, tactics, etc. 

GENERAL IDEA: 
  At first using python we create just a chess board with pieces, normal chess. then we add existing bots like stockfish to play with, also adding pass-and-play game type. adding elo regulator, to play with weaker
  bots. then add a mentor, same stockfish bot but with addictions, it has larger ability to talk/message, it could be able to deeply explain the move, tactic or sacrifice, often doing brilliant moves to make     
  training better. it should also teach us oppenings, midgames and endings. like a human mentor. often creating puzzles to solve in the middle of the game.
